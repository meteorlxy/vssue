# GitHub V4

::: tip
After you comment on an issue, the platform will send you emails when new comments come. The emails might be annoying when new users come and leave comments on this demo page.

You can go to the [issue page](https://github.com/meteorlxy/vssue/issues/1) and unsubscribe the notifications.
